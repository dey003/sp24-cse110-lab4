**Question 1:** `values added: 20`

**Question 2:** `final result: 20`

**Question 3:** `values added: 20`

**Question 4:** The code returns an error because `result` is defined using `let`, so its scope is only within the `if` statement. Thus, `result` is undefined in line 13.

**Question 5:** The code returns an error because `result` is defined using `const`, so the reassignment on line 7 causes an error.

**Question 6:** The code returns an error for the same reason as in Question 5.
